mc "Why would you think that, Yuri?"

"Yuri looks at me with parted lips, like she’s about to answer me, but decides against it at the last second. I give her a soft smile to encourage her."

mc "Yuri, you should know… I love reading with you, and I’d love it if we kept reading together."
y 2f "R-Really?"

"Now she looks relieved for whatever reason."
y 1a "Well then… if you need helping choosing a book…"
y 1i "I wouldn’t mind helping you…"
"I could see her gradually beginning to turn red, Even after all this time, I guess she’s still shy about being assertive. I need to encourage her more."
mc "That sounds great! I’d love to have your input since I don’t read too often… but I guess you knew that."
y 4i "Yes, unfortunately… but, well… I’m… determined to change that…!"
mc "Fantastic! I know you can. Do you want to go right now?"
y "N-Now?"
y "Well, actually, I really should get home today... Would tomorrow be alright, [player]?"
"Tomorrow, huh? Do I have anything planned…?"
"Upon further consideration, no, of course I’m free. I don’t have much of a life. I don’t really do much."
mc "Sure, tomorrow works for me.."
"Yuri smiles at me once more. It’s nice to see her so bright for a change."
y "Good, then we’ll meet again tomorrow!"
mc "Yup."
y "Oh, I’m so excited! I have so many good books in mind for you! Ah, maybe- oh…"
mc "What is it, Yuri?"
y " Um, well… I was wondering if maybe… you’d like to walk home together and discuss it…?"
mc "Alright! You don’t mind if Sayori walks with us, right? She always walks with me so… I can’t exactly leave her alone. You know how she is."
"A flash of disappointment appears on Yuri’s face,  but she replaces it with a small smile so quickly that I find myself wondering if it was ever there."
y "No, not at all..."
"Suddenly, Sayori popped up by my side. Speak of the devil and she shall appear, red bow and all."

s "Heeey!"
y "Hello, Sayori."
mc "Hey there."
s "What were you guys talking about?"
mc "Oh, we were just planning a meet-up tomorrow so Yuri can help me pick out a book."
s "Ooooh, is that so? Monika, Natsuki! [player] has a date with our own beloved Yuriiiiii!"
"Once again, Yuri’s face turns beet red. She bows her head, causing her hair to fall and cover her face. It’s such an automatic reaction that it almost seems habitual. [player] Don’t get ahead of yourself, it’s nothing like that.. We’re just going to a bookstore’ that’s all."
"But it was too late to convince Sayori of anything else. Our supposed date was now an unchangeable fact in Sayori’s mind."
s "[player] has a date, [player] has a daaaate!!"
"I sighed"
