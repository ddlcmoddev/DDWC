Harsh winds send my hair into a chaotic dance.
The cold slashes at my skin and bone.
The salty spray drenches me, one droplet at a time.
This is not a safe place, but it is a tranquil one.
I am on the boundary between worlds.
I could step forward.
I would plummet towards the emptiness.
But I would enter a new world.
The thought is intoxicating.
I grapple with the forbidden idea.
I am no wretched Pandora.
I shall not loose these demons.
I take a step back, and normality reasserts itself.
The sun is visible through the clouds in the distance.
The winds are calmer now, and the spray no longer reaches so high.
There is more than one way to find tranquility."""

he prison walls are made of glass.
A strange choice, but now they crack.
Silvery shards shatter and fall
I'm buffeted by millions of tiny points
But I am unharmed.

I am newly opened to ancient light.
My third eye gives me second sight.
I am looking upon the new Creation
That has existed outside my opaque glass walls
Since the dawn of time.

There is a choice! The path is clear.
There is no need to live in fear.
We already know the world is not perfect
But with a little bit of work
We'll make it right."""

The clouds are gone, the rainbow's here
Imploring us to draw near
Will we find a treasure there -
Jewels and wealth beyond compare?
Maybe it's just a fantasy
Of escaping from reality

When we find to our chagrin
That the ground around is barren
We put our hopes in fairytale
And our story surely fails
Shall we try again tomorrow?
Find another storm to follow?"""

We built ships
To tame the oceans
We built planes
To conquer the skies

Nor have we claws
But we invent
And we settle scores
Ours is the world
Under our eyes
Because we're human
Because we try."""
